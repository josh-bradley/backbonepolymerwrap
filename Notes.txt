Hybrid
- Wrapping vs replace one element at a time with pure Polymer/TPA element. 
- What is the migration look like? From a component level and from an app level. At the app level at different stages of the migration can we expect to have a mix of pure polymer, pure genoma and hybrid components
- How will build work Vulcanise mixing in with the existing Genoma build stuff
- What to do with existing unit tests. If we do a wrapper approach do we test both the wrapped and unwrapped version of the element or just the wrapped. 
- Events from genoma element to a polymer event. 
- How to expose the public interface of the Genoma element in the polymer element. 
- Using imperative or declaritive initialisation.
- How to best mix the require js stuff in with polymer.
- Is there a way to use the polymer template as the template for a backbone view. 

TPA
- Can the styles in the current TPA stuff be overridden by custom styles from Spain. 
- Requirements for element I.E. minimum level of documentation, unit testing, demo, folder structure, README.md 
- Investigate the existing yomeon generator for use in TPA. Or use the tpa-item. Do either of these need to be customised for ModelBank
- Investigate setting up the Travis if not using Travis how will CI work
- Set up catelog. 
- Get the WCT running on the dev environment. 
- How will development work alongside TPA will, components be added directly to into TPA or will there be a seperate set of repositories.
- Build process (Vulcanise)
- Building the container/base for an app. 
- How to manage security token/sessionid/ticket (tpa-globals, iron-meta)
- Eventing 
- What can be reused from TPA (analytics, globals)
- Internationalization (TPA version?)
- Can we get around the using bower issue? 
- Do we need to build on the BIAB? or can we build somewhere else and push to BIAB
- Take a Genoma element and migrate all its functionality one to one to a polymer component. 
- Backbone to Polymer migration guide
- Skills transition (Can we have documentation/brown bags to help developers make the move. Resources that would be useful for new devs?)


Both
- How will blueprints fit in? Can we generate the API from blueprints? 
- What headers, cookies and other is required by the current API.

Questions
- What is the process for merging back into TPA proper.
